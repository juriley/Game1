+Initial Game Manual

+This is a tetris copy for now.
+The rules are as follows
1.The player will control a falling block on a screen. They will do so with
+ the arrow keys corresponding to the direction of movement, except the up arrow will
+ rotate the block 90 degrees. 
2.Once the player is satisfied with position and orientation the block will 
+ fall to the bottom of the field of play where it will no longer be controlled
+ by the player. these are considered the dead blocks. 
3.The score will be determined by the number of rows filled by the blocks. The player wins 
+ if he/she reaches the target score and loses if one of the dead blocks extends beyond
+ the field of play.
